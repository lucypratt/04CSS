    <h2>5 Steps to Make Your Practice More Engaging: </h2>
    <p>One of the hardest parts of learning an instrument is finding the motivation to practice. The best way to combat this is to <strong>love the practice you’re doing!</strong> If you’re learning an instrument on your own, without the help of a teacher it can be difficult to know how and what to practice. Even with a teacher there is some freedom to design your practice time in the way that works best for you. There are a few ways to be more engaged in your practice, no matter the instrument. To outline a few:</p>
    <ul class="overview">
    <li><a href="#songs">Pick songs you love and are excited about.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#consistent">Set specific time each day for practice. <strong>Be consistent!</strong></a></li>
    <li><a href="#mix">Mix it up!</a> </li>
    <li><a href="#section">Section off your practice.</a> </li>
    <li><a href="#techniques">Try different practice techniques. </a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Read more about each of these steps below!</em></p>

    <h2 id="songs">Choosing Songs to be Excited about: </h2>
    <p>Many people choose to pick up an instrument because they want to play their favorite songs. This is a great reason to start learning an instrument and it can boost one’s motivation to practice regularly and with purpose. Not only does picking songs your favorite songs help you to get to practicing, it allows you to explore new music and learn new parts of music theory as they come up in the pieces you work on.  </p>
    <p>For music teachers, this is a great tool to challenge students and help them fall in love with music. Getting a student to practice can be a struggle that is often combated with incentives such as small weekly prizes. However, letting the student choose something to play for a recital piece or other special assignment gets them excited and yields better results.  </p>
    <p>It’s important to keep a steady flow of new songs and music so the practice doesn’t become monotonous and so that new challenges are introduced. That way practice becomes easier and learning is increased. </p>
    
    <h2 id="consistent">Build a Practice Habit: </h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgB_XfudqeU" target="_blank">Building habits is crucial to developing new skills or making progress in any area.</a> Lots of people build the habits of going to the gym each week, scheduling time for daily and weekly chores, or waking up early everyday so that after some time, these activities become easier and they begin achieving their goals behind creating the habit in the first place. This principle applies to learning an instrument as well. As you set a specific time and length of time to practice each day, a habit will be created and not only will one see dramatic improvement in their skills, practicing will become easier and for many, something to look forward to. </p>
    <h2 id="mix">Mix it up! </h2>
   <p>Playing a musical instrument should be a fun and often times relaxing experience, not something to dread or set rigid practice regimens for. If you find that your practicing process has become monotonous and boring it may be time to mix it up. Find new pieces to play, come up with or look up new warm ups that challenge you enough to help you improve, but not too complex that it creates frustration. Don’t use the same structure within a practice section every time; start with something you’re excited to play then work down to something that requires more focus as you ease into a practice section. It can be easier to look forward to practicing when it’s in a “choose-your-own-adventure" style. </p> 
    <h2 id="section">Section off Your Practice: </h2>
    <p>If you’re learning an instrument all on your own it can be difficult to know <em> how </em> to practice without a teacher giving you a specific set of instructions. One recommendation is to section off your practice time to allow for adequate time spent on each of the following: </p>
    <ol class="structure">
    <li>A warm up </li>
    <li>Technique building exercise </li>
    <li>Weekly song </li>
    <li>Theory practice/study </li>
    <li>A recital piece</li>   
    </ol>
    <p>Of course, when learning without a teacher you have all the freedom in the world when it comes to choosing a song, recital piece, warm up, and various other exercises; however, sectioning off your daily practice time allows for a myriad of skills to be developed consistently and worked on daily. </p>
    <h2 id="techniques">Don’t Get Overwhelmed by Challenging Music; Try Different Techniques: </h2>
    <p>There are many universally accepted practice techniques out there. There are also hundreds of musicians who have a favorite and will swear by it. However, as a new musician it is important to try out many different techniques to see which work best and which don’t work quite as well. </p>
    <p>Musicians at any level can agree that a new, long, and challenging piece can be overwhelming when looking at it all at once so it is important to work section by section so one’s focus isn’t spread over the entire piece. This technique is especially helpful to beginners who are still getting to know their instrument and developing muscle memory. Repetition of small sections of music allows opportunity to learn each piece really well and work through trickier techniques. Additionally, one may find it easier to get to know each intricacy of the song really well and put more energy into attention to detail.  </p>
    <p>On the other hand, some may find it easier to practice the entire piece, start to finish, over and over again. This can be good especially for sight-reading as it helps a lot when getting a feel for a song and how each part relates to the next. This technique is not the best for fine tuning and should be used towards the beginning of learning a new song. </p>

    <dl>
    <dt>Time Signature</dt>
    <dd>This tells how many beats per measure a song has. This is essential for counting rythms, keeping time, and understanding the feel of a song.</dd>
    <dt>Treble Clef</dt>
    <dd>Treble clef represents higher notes, often those above a middle C although the use of ledger lines allows lower notes to be played.</dd>
    <dt>Base Clef</dt>
    <dd>Base clef represents the notes lower than middle C. It is important to note that reading music in base clef and treble clef is differet.</dd>
